# Contributing to prview

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document covers the essentials.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (edition 2024) -- install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Git

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vetcoders/prview-rs.git
cd prview-rs
make install
make precheck
```

## Code style

- Format: `cargo fmt` (enforced in CI)
- Lint: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (zero warnings policy)

Run both before submitting a PR:

```bash
make precommit
make check
```

Process fixtures that use PID-file existence as a readiness barrier must write
the complete record to a sibling temporary file, close it, and rename it into
place. Creating the final path before writing its contents lets the parent
observe an empty record. The detached MCP reaper fixture follows this protocol.

Binary contract tests must set `PRVIEW_HOME` to a test-owned temporary directory
and keep that directory alive until all child processes finish. This prevents
fixture packs and lock state from leaking into the caller's storage. Preserve
each test's intended tool environment: gate exit-code fixtures deliberately
exclude Semgrep, since its absence is part of the verdict being tested.

## Making changes

This repo is trunk-based on `main`.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature / fix / chore branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Run the local gates before pushing:
   - `make precommit` — fast pre-commit gate
   - `make check` — full local gate (`cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` + `cargo test`)
5. Open a pull request against `main`; PRs land as merge commits (no squash)

## Commit conventions

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add risk scoring system
fix: handle empty diff in remote mode
refactor: consolidate check orchestration
test: add regression detector coverage
docs: update CLI help examples
chore: bump dependency versions
```

Scope is optional but welcome: `fix(dashboard): XSS in copy button`.

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused -- one logical change per PR
- Include a brief description of what changed and why
- Ensure CI passes (fmt, clippy, tests)
- Link related issues if applicable

## Release maintenance

Maintainers should use the repo-level helpers instead of ad-hoc commands:

```bash
make version TYPE=patch
make version-show
make version-check
make release-check
make release-plan
make release-tag
make release-push
make publish-checklist
```
